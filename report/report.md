## Introduction
### Project Overview

The "Smart Voice Light" project is a sophisticated lighting system activated and controlled through voice commands. It leverages a voice recognition model to interpret spoken instructions like "link," "cut," and "breathe," each triggering specific lighting responses. By integrating advanced machine learning algorithms with practical hardware components, the system allows users to manage lighting atmospheres hands-free.

### Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project stemmed from the growing demand for smart home technologies that enhance convenience and accessibility. In scenarios where manual interaction with devices is impractical or undesirable—such as cooking in the kitchen or when returning home with hands full—the ability to control lighting through voice can significantly enhance user experience and safety.

### Examples and Basis

The project draws on existing voice smart control products from products such as Amazon Echo , Google Home , Amazon Echo and Google Home as well as voice control that references various smart home features. However, unlike these products that rely on commercial cloud services, the "smart voice light" hardware runs entirely on local hardware. This approach ensures faster response times and protects user privacy. Furthermore, this project reflects a setup for real-time audio processing in embedded system design, making it a practical example of applying machine learning in an IoT environment.

## Research Question
Objective: How can voice recognition technology be effectively utilized to control lighting systems in a responsive and user-friendly manner?

## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
